Yo!

My given name is Saheed -- nick is `gyre`, if you want to be super-friendly.

I'm a polyglot developer focusing on low-level systems programming. I mainly use C, Python and Go. I'm also interested in OCaml, Rust and Zig (may become a main soon). I love exploring new technologies and languages. 

Some esoteric and cool stuff are hosted in [my SourceHut](https://git.sr.ht/~gyreas)

Very unemployed (I'll get back you).
